## fp-lang-for-llm
Now research then hopefully implementation of LLM friendly lang that compiles to fp lang

## Research material:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39619053#:~:text=IMHO%2C%20in%20the%20future%20programming,to%20generate%20provably%20correct%20code
https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13453


## Main guidelines(proposal):
- language to be very simple - so LLM can learn it in few shots
- declarative? 
- should compile to purely fp lang
- there should be cleaning pipeline - that corrects any misspels or small syntax mistakes of LLM
- do not use similar keywords to "limit halucination". Do not use `==` and `=`, do not use similar symbols.
- machine/llm first - optimized for LLM not for human reading
- avoid optional elements or multiple ways to express the same idea


## Other ideas:
- ask stronger LLM - (GPT Pro?) for proposals


## CI/CD:
- tries to compile and run code "code"
    - if fails takes "code" generated by AI, cleans it if needed with another LLM
- another LLM to generate specification for input data -> runs program (I guess property based testing) with generated data of given specification
