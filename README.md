## fp-lang-for-llm
Now research then hopefully implementation of LLM friendly lang that compiles to fp lang

## Research material:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39619053#:~:text=IMHO%2C%20in%20the%20future%20programming,to%20generate%20provably%20correct%20code
https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13453


## Main guidelines(proposal):
- language to be very simple - so LLM can learn it in fea shots
- declarative? 
- should compile to purely fp lang
- there should be cleaning pipeline - that corrects any misspels or small syntax mistakes of LLM



## Other ideas:
- ask stronger LLM - (GPT Pro?) for proposals
